# CS50 Week 3 - Algorithms

## Main Lecture
Normally I have separate entries for the main lecture and the shorts, but the lecture and short videos flow together. The topics covered in the lecture are gone into more depth in the shorts.

This lecture was more theoretical than anything, barely anything programming related was done. Yes, there's plenty of pseudocode, but ultimately it's about understanding algorithms and how they're applied to programming.

An algorithm is a set of instructions, some are more complex than others and the more complex ones can take longer to complete. When it comes to small data-sets, a complex algorithm can greatly reduce runtime. But for something that contains millions or billions or even greater amounts of data, the differences aren't as noticeable.

* Linear search
* Binary search
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort

These algorithms have pros and cons. Some are faster, some more complex, etc. They each also have a worst-case and best-case scenario, this is respectively known as **Big O Notation** and **Big Omega Notation** in computer science.
