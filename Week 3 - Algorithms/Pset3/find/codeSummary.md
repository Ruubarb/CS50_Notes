# Sorting Algorithm Summary

## Bubble Sort

### Summary
It goes index-by-index through the entire array. It compares the indices in pairs: **A** and **B**, **B** and **C**, **C** and **D**, and so forth as it goes through the array.  
If the value in **A** is greater than the value in **B**, **A** moves one position to the right. Now it gets compared to the value in **C**. If it's greater than **C**, it moves to the right again, or if it's less it stays in position.  
Now **C** gets compared to **D** and so forth.  
This happens until the largest value in the array gets pushed to the end. The process is repeated, with the last index(+1 after the first time) being ignored each time (*since it's sorted out*), until it's sorted.
