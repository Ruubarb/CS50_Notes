# Three Weeks of Week 2

I finished Week 2 of CS50, and it was a rough (couple of weeks). PSet 2 is the most difficult one I've faced so far, and I'm sure it gets tougher, but at least I completed it. For PSet 1, I did both the *least comfortable* and *more comfortable* problems, wanting to give myself a challenge, but in PSet 2, least comfortable whooped me real good. It's humbling, eye-opening, but also educational. 

## Problem Set 2
All three problems I completed mainly required knowledge of arrays and loops. The programmer needed to know how to loop through characters in a string, and output only certain characters in that string. For two of the programs, the characters were manipulated based on some kind of encryption (Caesar cipher and Vigenere cipher). Knowing how ASCII values work was also important, though not as difficult.

This wasn't easy for someone like me, who wants the program to work simply because I will it. The alphabet characters need to be converted to ASCII numbers, then back to encrypted alphabet characters. There's a lot more going on in-between, but that's the general gist of it. A loop was required since in C a string is an array, and each character in that string is part of the array's index. I've done simple things with loops in the past, but this one really pushed me, and I'm glad it did. Now I truly see the value of loops in all programming.

Another thing I understood is math in programming. I'm sure most people reading those words are laughing, of course computer programs require math! But allow me to explain....  
These programs need to complete a specific task, and for them to run accurately mathematical checks are needed. In both Caesar and Vigenere, modulos was needed, and without it the program would fail. And that's how I learned practical applications for math.
