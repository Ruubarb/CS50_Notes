0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
The longest word in a Oxford English dictionary, at 45 characters, "an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust."

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
This gets the resource usage, which can be done for itself, its children, or the calling thread

2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
16 members

3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
It's faster this way

4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
This is so words containing numbers or containing non-alpha characters (except apostrophes) aren't scanned over and spellchecked.

6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
So the values for them can't be changed either by the program or by accident
