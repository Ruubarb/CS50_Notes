### Arrays and Linked Lists
Both arrays and linked lists are collection of the same data type. They have their advantages and disadvantages.

With arrays, you can search for an element in the array without going through the entire array by simply looking for a particular index number. However, arrays have a fixed capacity, meaning if your array has a length of 100, adding 101 items or more causes problems.

With linked lists, the capacity is dynamic, it can expand and shrink as needed. However, a [linear search](https://github.com/00SaadChaudhry/CS50_Notes/blob/master/Week%203%20-%20Algorithms/notes.md#linear-search) needs to be done through the list to find one item, you can't just tell the program to specifically find an item.

Arrays and Linked Lists are used in the various data structures discussed here. Values can be added/removed using an array or a linked list. And in the case of Hash Tables, an array containing linked list elements is used.
