# Week 0 - The Intro Lecture

## Notes

Since I've been learning web development for a little over a year, I'm not completely new to this. Sure, I'm still a student seeking a junior web developer job, but compared to a year ago I'm not completely lost. 

### Binary
Professor David J. Malan first covers binary numbers, which I already knew, but I did find out bit stands for binary digits, so 8-bit means 8-binary-digits which would have a value between 0 and 256 **(I think)*.  
#### ASCII and RGB
ASCII is a way to represent binary numbers as human numbers into characters. So the binary value for 72 represents the letter H. RGB is similar, except it turns those human numbers into colors, and they range from 0 to 255.

### Algorithms
An algorithm is just a set of instructions. Even I used an algorithm for this entry:

1. Watch the lecture
2. During the lecture take handwritten notes
3. After the lecture is finished type the notes out in markdown editor
4. Post notes to GitHub

Of course our human brains don't process it like that, we intuitively do it. For computers it's different, they need to be told every step. The best kind of algorithms are the most efficient ones.
